Using LiDAR to improve Pileated Woodpecker models

Methods, code, and workflow.


Writing was done using [Scrivener](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/overview?gad=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwg-GjBhBnEiwAMUvNW-oncrjarOcTGUBrpc6sHLEmLE2FNFGBYBU7vUrfUiCeOF2JIP-lxRoC03IQAvD_BwE) and saved as a .scriv file. Scrivener integrates a bunch of usefull writing tools into a single application and is useful for writing, editing and structuring long documents. Because a scivener file is basically a directory of text files, it is easy to backup using Git version control. Scrivener can compile your writing into markdown files that can be intergrated into the rest of your R project workflow.
